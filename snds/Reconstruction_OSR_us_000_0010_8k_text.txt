Birch canoe slid on the smooth plank.
Glue the sheet to the dark blue background.
And it easy to tell the depth of a well.
These days chicken leg is a rare dish.
Rice is often served in round bowls.
The juice of lemons makes fine punch.
The box was done beside the park truck.
The hogs are fed chop corn and garbage.
For hours a study work faced us.
A large size and stockings is hard to sell.
